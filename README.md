## Usage

Once your bot is running, you can start adding commands and events. The framework provides a clear structure for organizing your commands. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how to create a command:

1. **Create a Command File**:

   Inside the `commands` directory, create a new file for your command, e.g., `ping.js`.

   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
       name: 'ping',
       description: 'Replies with Pong!',
       execute(message, args) {
           message.channel.send('Pong!');
       },
   };
   ```

2. **Register the Command**:

   Make sure to register your command in the main bot file, typically `index.js`.

   ```javascript
   const pingCommand = require('./commands/ping');
   client.commands.set(pingCommand.name, pingCommand);
   ```

3. **Handle Command Execution**:

   In your message event handler, add logic to execute the command when a user sends it.

   ```javascript
   client.on('messageCreate', message => {
       const args = message.content.split(/ +/);
       const commandName = args.shift().toLowerCase();

       const command = client.commands.get(commandName);
       if (command) {
           command.execute(message, args);
       }
   });
   ```

This simple example shows how easy it is to add new commands to your bot. The framework is designed to be intuitive and straightforward.
